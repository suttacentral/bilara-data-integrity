# sutta_processor

Process, check, and validate text from bilara-data and original ms_yuttadhammo source.

# Setting up

This package requires Python. It was tested using Python 3.7, so please make sure that version (or a newer one ) is available on your machine. If is isn't, please download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

1. Clone the repository to your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data-integrity.git
```

2. Clone bilara-data repository to your machine inside the bilara-data-integrity directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data.git
```

You should now have a directory structure like `path/to/bilara-data-integrity/bilara-data/`.

3. Create new virtual environment in the same directory as the cloned bilara-data-integrity.

```bash
python3 -m venv ./bilara-data-integrity/
```

4. Activate your virtual environment.

```bash
source ./bilara-data-integrity/bin/activate
```

5. Install requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Install application in developer mode. Note the "." at the end of the command.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

7. Try running the sutta-processor app.  It takes the config file as an argument.

```bash
sutta-processor -c run_all_checks_config.yaml
```

The config file is located here `bilara-data-integrity/run_all_checks_config.yaml`. 

# Running the application

Whenever you want to run a particular script from the app just change `exec_module` in `run_all_checks_config.yaml`. For example:

```bash
exec_module: 'bilara_check_html'
```

The default `exec_module` is `run_all_checks`.

`sutta-processor` operates in two different scopes:
1. all files found in the relevant directories, like `html ` or `root`
2. a list of files supplied to the application as arguments

Scope 2 is meant to run on a list of changed files from a git commit.

List of available scripts (unless otherwise noted, all scripts run in Scope 1):

- **check_all_changes** - run checks on supplied list of files (Scope 2)
- **run_all_checks** - run all available checks
- **check_migration** - cross-validate bilara-data text against original ms_yuttadhammo source files; the result will be saved to the path specified in `run_all_checks_config.yaml` file, by default: `./bilara-data/migration_differences`
- **bilara_check_comment** - check if path to comments is set up properly
- **bilara_check_html** - check if path to html files is set up properly
- **bilara_check_root** - check if path to root files is set up properly
- **bilara_check_translation** - check if path to translation files is set up properly
- **bilara_check_variant** - check if path to variant files is set up properly
- **bilara_load** - load bilara-data
- **noop** - no operation, available just for checking purposes

## Notes on exceptions

There are several false positives generated by `sutta-processor`.  These have been listed in the file `false_positives.yaml`, which is required by `sutta-processor` to run without raising errors for those false positives.
